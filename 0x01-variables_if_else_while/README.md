task0: program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative
code: printf("%d ", _variable_) -> generates random number

task1: program that print the last digit of the number stored in the variable
code:

task2: program that prints the alphabet in lowercase
code: putchar('\n') -> prints newline

task3: program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase

task4: program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except letters e and q
code: using _printf_ function

task5: program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0
code: using _printf_ function

task6: program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0
code: using _putchar_ function twice

task7: program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse
code: using _putchar_ function twice

task8: program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase
code: using _putchar_ function 3 times

task9: program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers
Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in ascending order
code: in _putchar_ function add **'0'** to forcefully convert int into character
	because _putchar_ is used to display chars

task10: program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits
*Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
*The two digits must be different*
*01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1*
*Print only the smallest combination of two digits*
*Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits *

task11: program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
The three digits must be different
012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
Print only the smallest combination of three digits
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
